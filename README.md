## About

This is the api for a MERN-stack prototype that will allow users to quickly and easily book an urgent care covid-19 testing appointment. In just a few steps you can:

- Book a new appointment by searching locations
  - filtered by the tests they require
  - sorted by nearest or next available time
- Create an account to maintain your current info
  - this submits your information to the clinic ahead of time
  - Sensitive information is filtered and encrypted
- View upcoming and past appointments
- Adjust personal app settings
